### **The Minecraft Recreation Project**
### *(Instructions Page)*

# How to Download

##### 1. You need to get a PC mouse, preferably USB but PS/2 will also work.
##### 2. Plug the mouse in the computer, assuming you're on a decent operating system you will get the driver installed automatically.
##### 3. Grab the mouse and move the arrow pointer to the branch context menu (Where it says main) and click the left mouse button (The one on the left side)
##### 4. All branches will appear now, you can choose the branch you wish to download stuff from.
##### 5. Now assuming you're in the branch directory, find the jar file you wish to download, and click on it.
##### 6. Press download.
##### 7. Navigate to your downloads folder to make sure you download a Minecraft remake and not a random raw temp file.
##### 8. You should have downloaded a remake now

# How to Install

### Betacraft

##### 1. Assuming you have the betacraft launcher, navigate to the betacraft directory, that's done by either going to your AppData/Roaming (%AppData%) or the local Betacraft directory of your launcher.
##### 2. Find a folder called "versions" and double click it to enter inside, You should place the jar file that you downloaded from the tutorial above there, That's done by pressing Copy on the jar file from the download folder, and pressing Paste inside the betacraft/versions folder.
##### 3. Navigate to the "jsons" folder inside the versions folder that you went into the last step. Now you need to find a .info file for the nearest version to the one you downloaded a remake of. (For example if you downloaded a 0.24 dev remake, that means you need to find 0.24_st_03.info file)
##### 4. Right click on the aforementioned .info file with the mouse you connected earlier in the download tutorial and click Copy. Then right click (The same button) and click Paste. It should create a copy of that .info file.
##### 5. Rename the info file so it has the same name as the jar file but ending with .info (If the jar's name is 0.0.14a_03.jar that means the info file has to be 0.0.14a_03.info)
##### 6. Restart Betacraft (That's done by closing the launcher if you have it opened, and opening it again)
##### 7. The remake version now should appear at the bottom of the version list (Assuming you know how to read)

### MultiMC

##### 1. Assuming you have MultiMC launcher, you need to open it (of course) and click the Add Instance button.
##### 2. Select Vanilla (That means not modded, but remakes are mods, so the question what is going on here will be answered later). You could enable the Alpha/Beta/Experimental and so on toggles to get more version choices on the menu.
##### 3. Select the closest version to the one you're downloading, with the exception of classic where you need to do this thing called Trial and Error swapping between 0.0.13a and 0.0.13a_03 until your game starts.
##### 4. Name your instance the name of the version you downloaded.
##### 5. Hit create instance (That will create quite some files on your computer, assuming you have free space)
##### 6. Right click on the instance you just created (With the mouse from the previous steps) and click "Edit Instance"
##### 7. Navigate to Version and find the button called "Replace minecraft.jar"
##### 8. Left click the button and find the jar file you downloaded from the step above (Assuming you haven't skipped steps)
##### 9. Press Open and the .jar file should load in the instance window.
##### 10. (Optional) You can add an icon to your MultiMC instance by right clicking it and pressing Change Icon, I have few example icons at this site: https://naskogdps17.7m.pl/remakes/mmc/
##### 11. Double click on the instance and it should load the game.










###### This tutorial is half-joke but there are some people that ask me really silly questions (Trying to be neutral here) so I hope I answered everything here...
